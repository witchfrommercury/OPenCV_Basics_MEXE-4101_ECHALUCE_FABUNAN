### Drawing Rectangles On Cars On The Highway

### ðŸš— Introduction

- In conclusion, geometric shapes are very important for computer vision tasks that have to do with cars; they are the critical tool for researchers and practitioners. They give a visual and mathematical representation of vehicles in a way that closes the gap between raw visual data and actionable insights. It is either in bounding boxes, polygons, or keypoints, which help algorithms to understand, process, and analyze complex scenes involving cars.

- Their applications range from far and wide, driving innovations in high-tech fields such as autonomous driving, where accurate car detection and tracking are essential for safety and efficiency. In traffic management, these shapes help monitor vehicle movements, analyze congestion patterns, and enforce regulations. Similarly, in smart surveillance systems, they enhance the ability to identify vehicles, recognize license plates, and even detect suspicious activities.

- Geometric shapes also find an important place in the improvement of model interpretability, validation of predictions, and rigorous testing. These shapes give a tangible means of visualizing model outputs, thus pointing out errors or areas for improvement. By using them in data augmentation and edge case handling, these shapes contribute to making robust and versatile models capable of performing reliably in various real-world scenarios.Therefore, the use of geometric shapes in computer vision not only enhances understanding of visual data but also propels innovation across a multitude of sectors, thus making them essential in the pursuit of smarter, safer, and more efficient technological solutions.

### ðŸš— Project Method

- Imports
```   
import numpy as np
import cv2
import threading
```
â€¢ numpy: Although unused in this code, it is often used in OpenCV for image manipulation (e.g., arrays for images).

â€¢ cv2: OpenCV's Python library for computer vision tasks such as image processing, object detection, and video manipulation.

â€¢ threading: Enables concurrent processing to handle multiple video files simultaneously, optimizing runtime when processing multiple videos.

---

- process_video Function
```   
car_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(haar_cascade_path)
```
â€¢ Haar cascades are pre-trained object detection classifiers.

â€¢ Here, a Haar cascade trained to detect cars is loaded.

```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
```
â€¢ Opens a video file for frame-by-frame processing.
```
frame_width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
frame_height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
fps = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
```
â€¢ Retrieves video properties such as width, height, and frame rate (FPS) for output video creation.
```
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
out = cv2.VideoWriter(output_path, fourcc, fps, (frame_width, frame_height))
```
â€¢ Sets up the codec (mp4v) for saving the processed video and creates a VideoWriter object.
```
ret, frame = cap.read()
gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
cars = car_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)
```
â€¢ Read each frame (cap.read()).

â€¢ Converts the frame to grayscale (cv2.cvtColor) as Haar cascades work best on single-channel images.

â€¢ Detects cars using car_cascade.detectMultiScale():

    â€¢ 1.3: Scale factor (how much the image size is reduced at each scale).
    
    â€¢ 5: Minimum neighbors (the number of rectangles around a detected region for it to be considered valid).
```
cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 0, 255), 3)
```
â€¢ Draws rectangles around detected cars on the frame.
â€¢ (0, 0, 255) specifies the rectangle color (red), and 3 is the thickness.
```
out.write(frame)
```
â€¢ Writes the processed frame to the output video.
```
cap.release()
out.release()
```
â€¢ Frees up memory by releasing the video capture and writer objects.

---

- Paths
```   
haar_cascade = 'haarcascade_car.xml'
videos = ['Car Set 1.mp4', 'Car Set 2.mp4', ...]
output_videos = ['Car Detector 1.mp4', 'Car Detector 2.mp4', ...]
```
â€¢ haar_cascade: Path to the Haar cascade XML file for car detection.

â€¢ videos: List of input video paths.

â€¢ output_videos: Corresponding output paths for processed videos.

---

- Multi-threading
```   
threads = []
for i in range(len(videos)):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=process_video, args=(videos[i], output_videos[i], haar_cascade))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```
â€¢ Purpose: Allows simultaneous processing of multiple videos to save time.

â€¢ Steps:

    â€¢ A new thread is created for each video using threading. Thread with process_video as the target function.
  
    â€¢ Threads are started using thread.start().
  
    â€¢ thread.join() ensures the main program waits for all threads to finish before proceeding.

---

- Completion Message
```   
print("Processing complete. All videos have been saved.")
```
â€¢ Indicates that all video processing is done.

---
Overall Workflow 
1. Open the video file and load the Haar Cascade model. 
2. Read frames from the video in a loop. 
3. Convert each frame to grayscale and detect cars using the Haar Cascade. 
4. Draw bounding boxes around detected cars. 
5. Save the processed frames to a new video file. 
6. Release resources when processing is complete.

### ðŸš— Conclusion

- This program is used to detect cars in a video using a Haar Cascade classifier as the feature descriptor. It takes frames from a given video file, detects cars, draws rectangles around them, and then writes the video output. In testing the system on five videos, it was observed that for some of the videos the system was only able to identify one car per frame, while for other videos the system was able to identify multiple cars in the same frame. This variability may be attributed to the quality of the videos used, lighting, camera view point, or just the nature of the Haar Cascade classifier. There could also be false negatives and inconsistent detections due to the use of pre-trained Haar Cascade features in the system (haarcascade_car.xml). Despite the fact that the code does its job of detecting faces in videos successfully, there are built-in object detection models like YOLO and SSD that could be used, or detection parameters could be tweaked for better results, or the quality of the videos could be enhanced using some pre-processing techniques. In summary, the system presented herein exhibits functional performance in car detection, but there is certainly room for improvement in terms of accuracy and stability.
